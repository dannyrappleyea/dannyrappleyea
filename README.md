# Hi ðŸ‘‹
I'm Danny Rappleyea: a seeker, hacker, writer, geek, and human.

That last designation becomes increasingly important in a world shaped by corporate greed and digital algorithms. Artificial intelligence might be answer, but right now that's a path leading straight towards The Matrix. I've started a single-member LLC named [DigitalReplica](https://github.com/digitalreplica) to explore what future technologies might bring and hack out a place for humans in it. 

I'm currently working on a digital knowledge system called [conceptual knowledge](https://github.com/digitalreplica/conceptual-knowledge), designed to be human and machine parsable, using a blend of markdown, yaml, and git repositories. You can see some of my public knowledge as the experimental, work-in-progress it is.
