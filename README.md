# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Danny Rappleyea: a seeker, hacker, writer, geek, and human.

That last designation is becoming increasing important as the world shifts to algorithms, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. I've started a single-member LLC named [DigitalReplica](https://github.com/digitalreplica) to explore what future technologies might bring, and how to hack out a place for humans in it. 

I'm currently creating a digital knowledge system called [conceptual knowledge](https://github.com/digitalreplica/conceptual-knowledge), designed to be human and machine parsable, using a blend of markdown, yaml, and git repositories. You can see some of my public knowledge. 

* [digitalreplica/hacking](https://github.com/digitalreplica/hacking): Penetration testing
* [digitalreplica/technology](https://github.com/digitalreplica/technology): Technology and security
* [drink-knowledge](https://github.com/dannyrappleyea/drink-knowledge): Open beer-rating system similar to [Untappd](https://untappd.com/)
