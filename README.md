# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Danny Rappleyea: a seeker, hacker, writer, geek, and human.

That last designation is becoming increasing important as the world shifts to algorithms, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. I've started a single-member LLC named [DigitalReplica](https://github.com/digitalreplica) to explore what future technologies might bring, and how to hack out a place for humans in it.
